# Adv_Databases_Project
God Tier Gains is a fitness and wellness tracker for users to interact and track their fitness progress across different metrics. The goal of this website is to make an interface that can be quickly referenced and appended without interrupting a workout routine. Users can create and edit their own routines with personalized workouts by filtering through the exercises provided by our app and adding them to their routines. They can also track their progress by jotting down post-workout logs and nutritional health. The last portion of this project targets achievement and motivation through the achievement section, which allows the user to view past awards they have earned and aspire to reach new achievements.
