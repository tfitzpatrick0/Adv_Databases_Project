Steps to export/import data from Oracle db to dump file:
On first time only:
1.) Ensure the scripts contain the proper Oracle login information for your desired user
2.) Create directory /usr/lib/oracle/xe/tmp
3.) As ec2-user, run the grant shell script which will log into SQL as the SYSTEM user, create SQL directory and grant permissions to regular user

For every export:
1.) Run the save_prev_exp shell script as root user 
	(you can use the command sudo su)
2.) As ec2-user, in system command line, run export shell script, which will run expdp with associated parameters to store entire database as dump file

To import:
1.) Run the import shell script as ec2 user
